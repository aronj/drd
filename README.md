# Dynamic Robot Defense

This is a clone of [Robot Defense](https://github.com/techannihilation/Robot-Defense) where Silver and Fast work on complete dynamic spawning of robots.

## TODO

- Add Bosses (strong units that spawn at stages).
- Add logic so Robots attack big eco spots first.
- Bonus for killing stuff in robot base - robot makes base.
